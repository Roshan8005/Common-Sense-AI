# Common Sense AI (Special Sense)
**Developed by Roshan Kumar Sah**

## 🧠 The Vision
"True intelligence begins with understanding, not computation." 

Common Sense AI is a breakthrough architecture that moves beyond standard probabilistic pattern matching. Inspired by the Vedic **Antahkarana** model, this system introduces a **Buddhi-Gate**—a logical discernment layer designed to solve the "Common Sense Gap" in modern AI.

## 🛠️ Technical Framework
This project utilizes a multi-layered comprehension engine:
1. **Manas (Perception):** Processing raw clinical/visual input.
2. **Buddhi (Intellect):** A Causal Logic Gate that filters for safety and logic.
3. **Chitta (Memory):** A recursive database of real-world "Samskaras" (scenarios).

## 🏥 Medical Application
As a BMIT student at RGUHS, I am specifically applying this logic to:
- Reducing false positives in **MRI/CT interpretation**.
- Ensuring AI safety in diagnostic radiology.
- Predictive safety for pediatric and elderly care.
